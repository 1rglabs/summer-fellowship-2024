This week I finally started some correspondences. I'm feeling cautiously
optimistic about these, I did find the writing more enjoyable and that it had a
bit more natural shape when I was directing it towards someone. So far I've sent
one to Max and one to my friend Amanda. 

I didn't copy the group on the one with Amanda, though I went back and forth on
that. My idea with the correspondences is that I'll initiate them with folks
where I feel an overlap in research interests that will benefit from the
dialogue, which includes y'all in my cohort but I have a few folks outside that
I'm also planning on writing. I found myself unsure how much I want to overload
them with the whole theory of what I'm doing, explaining who these folks I'm
CC'ing are, etc. On the other hand I think building up a shared corpus of ideas
between us will eventually create a micro-culture that sustains its own meaning
and shape within itself, and so adding new relevant conversations into that
micro-culture will help it reach that auto-poietic tipping point.

I also don't want to overload people. I've been feeling a bit of
self-consciousness around how much content and energy I'm injecting into the
system. I'm morally opposed to homework, and if this starts to feel like
homework it hasn't quite achieved its goal. There's an interesting balance in
trying to hold some amount of internally driven vision for what I'm trying to do
while also being responsive to what is working for others and what isn't.

I had a call with Jess recently and we talked about how this is what it's like
with comedians, they're constantly trying out their new material on audiences,
keeping the jokes that work and tweaking and dropping the ones that don't. A
feedback loop in relationship with The Public. In the extreme this leads to
exactly the kinds of audience capture dynamics which I want to avoid (and one
reason that I'm not doing this work in the full chaos of Twitter or other
"communities" of millions), but held in the right balance a comedian can have
their own voice while also responding to what resonates.

So, perhaps that's the strategy here, we're trying out various jokes: "let's do
weekly reflections", "let's have a weekly meeting", "let's start
correspondences", "let's start a reading group" and then seeing what makes the
others laugh.

There's a connection here to Serena's research of course, and 1rg itself. You're
trying to hold some vision of what you're trying to do, while also responding to
the needs and desires of the community. The art will be in threading between the
absurd extremes "do whatever until you hit product-market fit", or full egoic
"I'll do whatever the heck I want". And some measure of success will be when
things happen without you being the source of energy, (like member--run side
project nights). Similarly with the fellowship work, I will be excited when
folks meet without me, or initiate a correspondence that I'm copied on but not
one of the correspondents.
