I've articulated a secondary goal for this fellowship for me is to learn to think by writing, and I recently came across an essay titled [Writing to Think](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/writing-to-think) by [Henrik Karlsson](https://substack.com/@henrikkarlsson)[^1] which seems to articulate both a *reason* and a *method* for what I'm trying to do.

## Why?
The essay opens with a Paul Graham[^2] quote

> _The reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point \[that writing helps you refine your thinking\] is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial._

> It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.

It's quite likely that I've read this essay before and internalized this message, because I was trying to articulate (orally!) something very similar when I was reflecting on the emails I've been sending as part of our "republic of letters" -- I look upon what I have written and I despair: I barely think anything! And what I do think are short snippets of ideas, underdeveloped, and ready to fall apart at the lightest touch of scrutiny.

But Karlsson offers a ray of hope:
>Seeing your ideas crumble can be a frustrating experience, but _it is the point_ if you are writing to think. You want it to break. It is in the cracks the light shines in.

I write the first draft, and then despair because the distance to something polished is so so vast. The words are wrong, and the ideas they try to capture are even wrong-er. But but but my goal doesn't have to be a polished final version, and instead it is to interrogate my ideas in the writing itself.

And Karlsson offers some techniques

## How?

I'm very interested in the technique he describes as unfolding. After you form your conclusion, you spread it into a series of positive assertions that you can then interrogate, in a loving way:

> The emotional tone of these questions is, in my head, lovingly curious; I’m not trying to put myself down. I’m trying not to kill ideas. I want to help them evolve and spill forth more insight. Often this dialogue ends with me changing my mind about several premises and coming to a different conclusion, but the original idea remains the seed—no less valuable for having been proven wrong. It takes creativity and boldness to leap out and form a conclusion, and the part that criticizes must understand how dependent it is on the part that throws ideas at the wall. It is often easier to criticize than it is to synthesize a new position.

I aspire to such loving curiosity in all my relationships, including myself!

Here goes:

- It's a good use of my time to invest into "thinking by writing" because it will not just improve my writing but help refine my thinking process
- Improving my writing will me better communicate and collaborate
- Refining my thinking process will help me generate and interesting and creative ideas, and be rigorous about thinking through them
	- Is being more rigorous "good"?
		- I have an emotional body-feeling that more rigour in my thinking would improve it, but I struggle to articulate why. I can also imagine an argument for thinking in some ways that doesn't align with what I think of as mathematical rigour[^3]
			- There's also lots of anecdotal evidence from people who are, if not good at thinking at least good at arguing, that writing helps them think. For example Paul Graham's quote above, and the essay I'm writing about itself.

## But really, how?
1) [Switching to Obsidian](https://cosocial.ca/@mveytsman/112751323391640516) is already helping, as I wrote this in Obsidian and feel like it's a better medium for this kind of writing than both Noteplan or markdown in vscode for the blog
2) Practice I guess!

[^3]: I could probably learn more about kinds of thinking that don't map onto the mathy parts of my brain by engaging more with Cheryl's research and getting more insight in what it means to perceive things through a more spiritual lens. To be honest I'm not even sure if that sentence is an accurate description of what she's thinking about - I'd like to understand her work better, but perhaps I can leave that as a goal orthogonal to the one described here.
